Welcome to the English version of my blog! ðŸŽ‰

This is an exciting milestone - I've successfully implemented multilingual support for this Hugo-based blog. Now I can share my thoughts and experiences in both Korean and English.

## What This Means

Having a multilingual blog opens up new possibilities:

1. **Broader Reach**: I can connect with readers from different linguistic backgrounds
2. **Better Expression**: Sometimes certain concepts are better expressed in different languages
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Writing in English helps me practice and improve my language skills

## Technical Implementation

This multilingual setup uses Hugo's built-in i18n features:
- Language-specific content directories (`content/ko/` and `content/en/`)
- Separate menus and navigation for each language
- Language switcher in the header
- Proper URL structure (`/` for Korean, `/en/` for English)

## What's Next

I'll be gradually adding English translations for existing Korean content, starting with the most popular posts. Not every post will be translated - I'll focus on content that has broader appeal and relevance.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content useful! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
