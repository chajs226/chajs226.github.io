Welcome to the English version of my blog! 

This is a test post to demonstrate the multilingual functionality of this Hugo site. From now on, I'll be writing posts in both Korean and English to reach a broader audience.

## What You Can Expect

- Technical insights and tutorials
- Book reviews and reflections  
- Personal thoughts on software development
- Learning experiences and discoveries

## Language Support

This blog now supports:
- ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· Korean (default)
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English

You can switch between languages using the language switcher in the header.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the content helpful!
