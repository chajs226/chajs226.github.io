## Quiet Experimenter

I work in IT at a hospital, contributing to better healthcare services by integrating technology into clinical settings. I find joy in small experiments that solve everyday inconveniences, creating gradual change through these attempts.

- Good at delivering unexpected jokes with a serious face 😑
- A pragmatist who prefers "just make it first" over perfection
- Tends to struggle with things I want to excel at
    - Piano at beginner level for 10 years straight 🎹
    - All that money spent on English courses... 😭
